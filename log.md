# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: December 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Returned back to freeCodeCamp to complete the Responsive Web Design Certification

### Day 2: December 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML section and moved into the CSS section

**Thoughts**: Learned how to override external css styling (like from libaries) via !important // ex: .pink-text { color: pink !important; }


**Link(s) to work** n/a

### Day 3: December 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS section and got midway through the Applied Visual Design section.

**Thoughts**: The CSS section touched on CSS variables (how to use them, override them, and use fallbacks). The AVD section covered so far positioning, z-index, and margin auto. Lastly, I updated my freeCodeCamp portfolio

### Day 4: December 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a few parts of the AVD sections

**Thoughts**: Wasn't feelings well today so I spent most of it recuperating. Learned about adjusting the hue of a color ex. hsl(180, 40%, 45%);

### Day 5: December 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Visual Design section...woohoo!

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit better from my cold. Learned about CSS gradients, animations, transforms, and how to make shapes like hearts then make the beat. Loved it!
ex.
background: linear-gradient(35deg, red, white);
** produced a gradient at a angle between the two colors

background: repeating-linear-gradient(
      45deg,
      yellow 0px,
      yellow 40px,
      black 40px,
      black 80px
    )
** produces yellow and black stripes at an angle.

#ball2 {
    left: 65%;
    transform:scale(1.5);
  }
** increased the size of the element to half more of the current size.

 div:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
  }
** adds a transform on hover.

#bottom {
    background-color: blue;
    transform: skewX(24deg);
  }
** skews the element on the x axis

  #top {
    background-color: red;
    transform: skewY(-10deg);
  }
** skews the element on the Y axis

.center
{
  position: absolute;
  margin: auto;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  
  background-color: transparent;
  border-radius: 50%;
  box-shadow: 25px 10px 0px 0px blue; 
}
** creates a cresent moon

### Day 6: December 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Applied Accessibility section of the Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts**: Learned about fieldset and legend for forms, tabindex, and accesskey.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the strongest contrast. There are many contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you.

Some online color picking tools include visual simulations of how colors appear for different types of colorblindness. These are great resources in addition to online contrast checking calculators.

Avoid using "click here" for links. Using accesskey for links.
tabindex=0 allows accessibility focus on desired elements when using the tab key.

<header> </header>
<main> </main>
<article> </article>
<footer> </footer>
<nav> </nav>
<fieldset> </fieldset>
<legend> </legend>

### Day 7: December 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Flexbox Challenges, CSS Grid sections of the Responsive Web Design certification. Now beginning to Responsive Web Design Projects. Close to certification! Woohoo!

**Thoughts**: Flexbox and Grid presented some information that went over my head. However, I know using the code over and will present familiarity.

### Day 8: December 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Build A Survey part of the Responsive Web Design Challenges.  

**Thoughts**: Missed a few days. Why do I always start challenges during the holidays? Guess it's that end of the year thang. Kinda lost some of the insight I had on CSS, inputs, but the referenced CodePen was resourceful in having the code there. I also had to Google how to make a responsive textarea. This overall felt good to get this done. I'm that much closer to my certification.
