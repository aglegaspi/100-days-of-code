##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: December 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS section and got midway through the Applied Visual Design section.

**Thoughts**: The CSS section touched on CSS variables (how to use them, override them, and use fallbacks). The AVD section covered so far positioning, z-index, and margin auto. Lastly, I updated my freeCodeCamp portfolio
