# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: December 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS section and got midway through the Applied Visual Design section.

**Thoughts**: The CSS section touched on CSS variables (how to use them, override them, and use fallbacks). The AVD section covered so far positioning, z-index, and margin auto. Lastly, I updated my freeCodeCamp portfolio

### Day 4: December 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a few parts of the AVD sections

**Thoughts**: Wasn't feelings well today so I spent most of it recuperating. Learned about adjusting the hue of a color ex. hsl(180, 40%, 45%);

### Day 5: December 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing the AVD section

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit better from my cold. Learned about gradients
ex.
background: linear-gradient(35deg, red, white);
** produced a gradient at a angle between the two colors

background: repeating-linear-gradient(
      45deg,
      yellow 0px,
      yellow 40px,
      black 40px,
      black 80px
    )
** produces yellow and black stripes at an angle.

#ball2 {
    left: 65%;
    transform:scale(1.5);
  }
** increased the size of the element to half more of the current size.

 div:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
  }
** adds a transform on hover.

#bottom {
    background-color: blue;
    transform: skewX(24deg);
  }
** skews the element on the x axis

  #top {
    background-color: red;
    transform: skewY(-10deg);
  }
** skews the element on the Y axis

.center
{
  position: absolute;
  margin: auto;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  
  background-color: transparent;
  border-radius: 50%;
  box-shadow: 25px 10px 0px 0px blue; 
}
